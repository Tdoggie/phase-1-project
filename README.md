# 🚀 Airplane Risk Analysis for Business Expansion

## 📌 Project Overview
As part of a company's diversification strategy, this analysis aims to assess the risks associated with different airplane types. Understanding accident trends and risk factors will aid in making informed investment decisions in the aviation sector.

## 📊 Dataset
The analysis utilizes **The NTSB aviation accident database**, which contains information about aircraft models, accident dates, causes, and other relevant attributes.

## 🔍 Methodology
This project follows a structured approach:

1️⃣ **Data Exploration**  
- Dataset loading to aid examination of its structure, column names, and data types.  
- Identification of missing values and inconsistencies within the dataset.  
- Computation of initial descriptive statistics to gain an overview of key attributes.  

2️⃣ **Data Cleaning**  
- Handling of missing values through imputation or removal where necessary.  
- Standardization of data formats and correction of inconsistencies.  
- Filtering of records to retain only relevant data for meaningful analysis.  

3️⃣ **Data Visualization & Analysis**  
- Generation of visual representations to explore patterns and trends in the data.  
- Application of statistical methods to analyze key aspects of the dataset.  
- Examination of relationships between variables to uncover potential insights.  

4️⃣ **Business Recommendations**  
- Summarization of findings based on the conducted analysis.  
- Provision of data-driven recommendations informed by identified trends.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, TheFuzz)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
